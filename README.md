## Developed a machine learning-based predictive model to forecast student performance in online courses by analyzing key factors such as attendance, engagement, and assessment scores. This project enables educators to proactively identify students who may require additional support, leading to more effective interventions and improved learning outcomes. The model predicts student performance in various assessments, offering valuable insights for academic success and retention strategies.

>
> **DATASET:**
>
>_**Dataset Heading:** Student Performance Data._
>
>_**Source:** Open University Learning Analytics Dataset (OULAD) repository._
>
>_**Description:** This dataset gives us a peek into how students interacted with online courses at the Open University in the UK from 2013 to 2014. It tells us things like who the students are, which  courses they took, how they did in assessments, and more. This data is super important for understanding how students learn online and for making online education better._
>
>_**Date Range:** 2013 to 2014._
>
>_**Columns/Variables:** Student Name, Enrollment No, Gender, Contact No, Semester, Degree Name, College Name, University Name, Online Course Media, Conducted Classes, Attended Classes, Diagnostic Assessments Grade, Formative Assessments Grade, Interim Assessments Grade, Summative Assessments Grade._
>
>_**Size:** 16 rows x 15 columns._
>
>_**Format:** xlsx (EXCEL SHEET)_
>
>_**License:** Open Database License (ODbL)._
>
>_**Preprocessing Steps:** Data cleaning and processing may involve handling missing values, converting data types, and aggregating information for analysis._
>
>_**Relevance to the Project:** This dataset is utilized for predicting student performance in online classes using machine learning techniques. The data includes attributes such as student demographic information, enrollment details, course participation metrics, and assessment grades across various types of assessments.Key features such as attendance, engagement, and assessment performance will be used to build predictive models for identifying students at risk of underperformance and implementing targeted interventions to improve outcomes. Additional features may be derived from the existing data to enhance the predictive
accuracy of the models._
